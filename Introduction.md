There are 4.1 million social homes in the UK [link](https://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2015/nov/18/who-lives-41-million-social-housing-homes-england-wales) out of 23 million homes/households in England in total [link](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20160105160709/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/census/2011-census/detailed-characteristics-on-housing-for-local-authorities-in-england-and-wales/short-story-on-detailed-characteristics.html)

In 1979, 42% of Britons lived in council homes. Today that figure is just under 8%. [link](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/04/end-of-council-housing-bill-secure-tenancies-pay-to-stay)

In England, social housing accounts for 17% of all households [link](http://england.shelter.org.uk/campaigns_/why_we_campaign/Improving_social_housing/who_gets_social_housing)

How is social housing allocated?
The main factors are:
Whether the individual is eligible to apply
Whether there is enough social housing to go around in their area

All local authorities are free to set their own housing allocation policy as long as they agree to certain rules.

By law, local authorities must clearly set out procedures and priorities by which social housing will be allocated, and must make sure that information on these policies is made available to the public. <<we could in theory get hold of this information>>
