### Tentative Deadline: 11th JULY

We would like to do a visual essay on social housing in the UK. Early stages at the moment, so feel free to throw out ideas (as wild and wacky as you like) and we'll try to settle on something more focused in due time.


### High priority to dos:
- Find datasets relating to the topic. For each dataset it would be good to write a little about what it includes and doesn't includes, and maybe some ideas on how it will be useful.
- Create a running list of 'research questions' - these will be useful to guide us towards a final product

### To do if you have the time:
- Basic exploratory analysis on the data to see what's in the data

### In future:
- Think about the ways in which we can link the different data sets together
- Deployment - can we set up some kind of testing/deployment infrastructure


We will be using D3.js (v4?) mostly for the final product, but feel free to use whatever tools you are most comfortable with in the early stages (Awais will likely be using Python / Pandas in iPython notebooks).
