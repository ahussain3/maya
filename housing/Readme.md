# HOUSING

The goal of this mini-project is to:
- show a map of London
- break down average house price by postcode / constituency / borough
- be able to see trends in house price over time
- segment by property size / bedrooms etc

The tentatative dataset is sourced from the UK land registry:

[downloads](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/price-paid-data-downloads)
[detailed documentation](http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/app/root/doc/ppd)

Challenge I foresee - there is just so much data. 20 million rows going from 1995 to now.
Obviously not practical to display all of this, so we will need to find some representation which is better for display.

This is a helpful resource, someone doing something very similar:
